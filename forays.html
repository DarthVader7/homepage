                    <p>I along with my friend <a href = "https://in.linkedin.com/in/ankit-kumar-parsurampuria-0705952a">Ankit</a>, maintain a <a href = "https://90percenthumour.wordpress.com/">blog</a> titled <a href = "https://90percenthumour.wordpress.com/about-us/">90%Humour</a>. With so many places to see, adventures to experience, books to read and thoughts to ponder upon, our quest with curiosity has only begun. On 90%Humour, we catalouge some of our experiences, as and when we feel a spur of creativity (failing more often than we desire to). Since we started this venture only an year ago in January 2014, we still have a lot to look forward to.</p>

                    <p>Education system in India is highly competitive and fast evolving. In this setting there is a need for quality education in science and mathematics for low-income high-school students. <a href = “”>Avanti Fellows</a> strives towards providing this education.

                    <p>I have inherited some hobbies from my father and together we have developed some new ones. We share common interests in philately and numismatics. Few years back we started photographing birds in the campus of RRCAT and the surrounding areas of Sirpur Lake in city of Indore. Over the years we have travelled to different parts of India and photographed more than 100 species of birds in our pursuits. We have catalogued this amazing diverse world of birds which is usually eludes our eyes. </p>

                    <p>Through some occasional exploits I try to keep up with my interest in the marvels of Astronomy and Astrophysics.I often dabble in night-sky observations with a <a href = “http://www.skywatcher.com/products.php”> Sky-Watcher 1309</a> telescope. I am also trying to learn some skills of astro-photography. I along with some friends attempted, with a partial success, to build a simple interfereomter based antenna, during a rather exciting course on Radio Astronomy under the supervsion of <a href=“https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/rks”>Prof. Shevgonkar </a> at IIT Delhi. While at IIT, I was a member of the burgeoning <a href ="https://www.facebook.com/astronomy.iitd/">Astronomy Club </a>. Here is a link to an Inter-college Astro-Quiz I conducted in March 2013.</p>
